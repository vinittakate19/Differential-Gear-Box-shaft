# Differential Gearbox Shaft – Design & Analysis (SOM)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on the **design and structural analysis of a Differential Gearbox Shaft** subjected to **combined torsional and bending loads**.  
The design is carried out using **Strength of Materials (SOM) principles**, followed by **CAD modeling** and **Finite Element Analysis (FEA)** for validation.

The objective is to ensure **strength, stiffness, and safety** of the shaft under realistic loading conditions used in power transmission systems.


## 🛠 Tools & Software Used
- **Autodesk Fusion 360** – 3D CAD modeling
- **ANSYS 2025 R2** – Static Structural FEA
- **Strength of Materials** – Analytical design calculations
- **Programming (Python)** – Result verification


## 🔧 Methodology
1. Determination of shaft loads (torque & bending)
2. Analytical stress and deformation calculations using SOM
3. Shaft diameter selection based on strength criteria
4. 3D modeling of shaft and splines in Fusion 360
5. Stress concentration reduction using fillets
6. Static Structural FEA in ANSYS
7. Validation of analytical and FEA results


## 📊 Key Results
- **Maximum Equivalent (von Mises) Stress:** ≈ 152 MPa  
- **Maximum Deformation:** ≈ 0.111 mm  
- Stress concentration observed near **spline regions**
- Analytical and FEA results matched within **±5%**
- Design verified as **safe under applied load conditions**
